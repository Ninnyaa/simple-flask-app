<p>Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, or FFXIV ARR, is a subscription-based pay-to-play 3D fantasy-themed
    MMORPG from gaming giant, Square Enix. The game was released for Windows, PS3, and PS4 on August 27,
    2013 and is a re-launch of the original Final Fantasy XIV which was shut down in November 11, 2012 
    due to largely negative reviews. The aptly named re-launched version featured a different game engine,
    revamped gameplay, improved user interface, and a brand new story.</p>
<p>The events of A Realm Reborn take place in the mythical realm of Eorzea, five years after the apocalypti
    events that concluded the original FFXIV. Players take on the role of Warriors of Light, heroes who have
    escaped the devastation by travelling through time five years into the future. They return to a realm 
    rising from the ashes and rebuilding from the wake of destruction left behind by Bahamutâ€™s release from 
    his lunar prison while also dealing with the looming threat of invasion from the Garlean Empire to the north.</p>
